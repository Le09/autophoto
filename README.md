# pytex

## Description

Get a photo album from your holidays in an instant!

## Usage
Put the photos you want to turn into an album into some folder FOLDER.

Simply use ./script.py FOLDER, and voil√†!

A photo album is created into a newly created folder.
Since the output is random, you can run the script multiple times.

Since it outputs basic Latex, it can also be edited by hand afterwards.


## Requirements

Latex, Python3

## TODO

- [ ] Incomplete tasks
    - [ ] Adapt the script to work allow to specify if the image holders are vertical or horizontal
    - [ ] (?) Linux installation script
