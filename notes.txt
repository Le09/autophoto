How it works:

Input: Folder 
which (maybe) contains images

The initial latex file only contains the default template.

Output:
We want to put these images inside selected templates, to create a photo album.

Folder' 
containing the modified latex files, where: 
- main'.tex is a copy of main.tex with the additional template(s) (adding path_main_tex(template), using replace, addTemplate)
- for each page (following a template) of images, we create a subfolder that has copied the selected image(s) (using createTemplateFolder(template), path_from_root(template)) 
and we copy and modify the corresponding template (adding path_photo_tex(image), using replace)
___
Functions:

isImage(file) opens the file if it is an image, returns False otherwise

getDim(image) returns a tuple (width, height)

isHorizontal(image) tests if width >= height 

horizontal(Folder) returns the number h of strictly horizontal images

load_templates(template_folder) (not in diagram) returns a list with the template name, and how many images of horizontal, vertical, or "doesn't matter" kind it accepts (h_holes etc)

replace(input_path, output_path, pattern, sub_list) takes input_path, copies it in output_path, and replaces occurrences of pattern with elements in sub_list

Questions/Remarks:
- main is only called on Folder
- We only extract the images from Folder, not from its subfolders
- We always have the photo album main.tex, which contains the default template template1 (template_1 in the diagram)
which can take any image and put it alone in a page
- h_holes: accepts horizontal and square images
s_holes: accepts any image
- For the moment, additional templates are added outside of the script
- How to select which templates we use, in what order?
	- Need to use h, v, s, 
	find a way to combine with h_holes, v_holes, s_holes
	(always use template1, or random, or manual, or use a function so that all templates are completely filled)
- If our input folder = 4 horizontal images, and our templates = default (template1), 2 vertical images (template2), 1 horizontal image on top of 2 vertical images (template3)
What should we return?
Can we return a blank page? 
Can we return 4 pages with template3?
- Think about regular expressions to use replace
- Write a template that works with any set of images
- Is it ok to copy by hand additional templates in the right folder, or should it be done in command line?
(e.g. if it's in home/sleeptodream)

LATER:
- What should happen if we call functions with wrong input? (exceptions)
- What to return if no image in input folder?
- How do we remove/replace/move a specific image?
- How do we change the page order?
- What if we want to call main on several folders?
- Call main on subfolders of Folder?
